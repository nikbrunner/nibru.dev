# Project â€” nibru.dev - next

This is the next version of my personal website.

## Run

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Stages

### Stage 1

	-	Experiences

### Stage 3

## Ideas

- [Bubble Like Chart for Skills](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@weknow/react-bubble-chart-d3)?
- Bauhaus Colors with Cells?
- What about experience with libraries?
- A proper image gallery section for NBP

```tsx
<GalleryImage 
   href="/images/nbp-12.webp"
   description="Arbersee September 2021" 
   meta="Fuji X-H1" 
   margin="1rem"
 />
```

## Research

- Why does the `export` script does not work when opening as a file in browser?
- Research how to work with .env Variables for Prod and Deploy
- TailwindCSS 
  - If TailwindCSS proves to be good, it would streamline some problems
