          <Paragraph>
            As far as software development is concerned, I try to put a lot of
            emphasis on good architecture and elegant, yet readable code. I
            don&apos;t want to stick a band-aid on a problem, but try to understand
            and heal the wound.

            experiences make me a better developer.
