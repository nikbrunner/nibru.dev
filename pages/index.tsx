            My main stack consists of <strong className="font-bold">React</strong>
            , <wbr />
            <strong>TypeScript</strong> and <strong>SCSS</strong>, but in my free
            time I try to explore other technologies, frameworks, architectures and
            best practices with some side projects.

          <Paragraph>
            As far as software development is concerned, I try to put a lot of
            emphasis on good architecture and elegant, yet readable code. I
            don&apos;t want to stick a band-aid on a problem, but try to understand
            and heal the wound.

            Yeah this probably sounds confusing, but now since 2020, I work as a
            Software Engineer, and I am very happy with my path, and I also think my
            previous experiences make me a better developer.
